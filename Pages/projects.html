    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p>The main goal of our senior design project is to provide protection 
        through a versatile security camera software solution that makes passage 
        entry for buildings and apartments seamless using facial detection. 

        By using artificial intelligence, security is provided by using facial detection to determine
        if a person has been registered in the security system to be allowed inside the premises. 
        We are not limited to just facial recognition, we also utilize object classification, 
        for example, if a person is holding a weapon, the system will be able to classify it 
        and notify the residential owner or the security team of the business. 

        Additional security features include malicious action detection if a person performs 
        something deemed ‘suspicious’ such as an arm in a right-angle position turning towards 1
        80 degrees, an action synonymous with banging, then it would be logged and notified to the owner.
        Facial recognition will be done by using machine learning platforms and application program interfaces such as 
        TensorFlow and Keras to train a set of images of people who are allowed inside in various different 
        situations along with images of people who aren’t allowed. In addition, we will use these machine learning platforms to 
        classify objects that would be considered suspicious and document unauthorized intrusions of people. 
        Then through a control system, we can send alerts to the user through a mobile app that works in tandem 
        with the security system. Malicious action recognition will be trained through videos of people acting out certain actions. 
        The app itself will also offer smart features that are free and non-subscription based which is a prevalent 
        model in the market such as a server where it will house the recorded footage as well as databases that will log entries.
